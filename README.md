# Few shot music generation
Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success
in areas where large amount of data is readily available,
but they tend to under-perform when data is scarce. Recent
advancements in few-shot learning, pioneered in the fields
of computer vision and reinforcement learning, showed
promising results for addressing data scarcity. While successful
in the task of image classification, few-shot learning
has not seen many applications pertinent to long time-series
inputs such as music. The scarcity of the music stems from
the observation that artists usually have a limited number
of work in their lifetimes. In this work, we demonstrate the
feasibility of few-shot learning on long sequential data and
present an end-to-end model for generating music in the
style of particular artists by means of density estimation
